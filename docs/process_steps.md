Om Guruve Thunai!
Always place Siva swamigal’s photo on a clean white cloth. In front of the photo, light a lamp with ghee or oil, and offer a few flowers. 
This pooja may be performed by anyone without any distinction of gender, caste, religion etc, but the person must eat purely vegetarian food. Being compassionate by choosing only vegetarian food is the first step towards worshiping Siva swamigal. 
Ensure that this pooja is performed every Pournami and Amavasya day. It is recommended to perform it every day. This pooja may be performed at any time, but performing it in the morning or evening sandhya kalam is ideal.
Before performing pooja, ensure that you are in a clean condition. Taking a bath is recommended.
Pooja steps:
Sit down in any comfortable pose. Keep your eyes closed during the entire process, except when you need to apply vibhuti or offer a flower.
Offer a prayer, requesting Siva swamigal’s presence and guidance during this pooja. 
Take 3-5 deep breaths and be relaxed. 
Take a pinch of vibhuti. Say the mantra Om Guru three times. Gently press the spot in between the two eye brows with the vibhuti and apply it with a gentle pressure.
Sit silently for a few seconds with attention on the spot between the two eyebrows.
Chant Siva swamigal’s moola mantra 3 to 11 times. It is recommended that you chant loudly, rather than mentally.
Om. Vang! Vasi chittaya vidmahe
Sing! Siva priyaya dheemahi
Thannoh Siva prachotayat!
Sit silently for a few minutes in Siva swamigal’s presence with gentle focus at the spot between the eyebrows. You may slightly tilt your head upwards to make it easier to bring the focus there. It is recommended that you keep your hands turned upwards and open. 
When you are about to get up, pray that Siva swamigal’s grace should stay with you and pray that all beings experience love and happiness. Gently open your eyes. 
This pooja may be shared with anyone who wishes to experience Siva’s swamigal’s love and grace. Please ensure that people who receive it from you follow a vegetarian diet.
